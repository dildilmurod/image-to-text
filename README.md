# image-to-text
Here I made a simple 'Image to text' module in python with open-cv and pytesseract. It works with simple plain text images. To work with difficult graphical images and texts, it should be optimized. It made for educational purpose

We need open-cv and pytesseract

Opencv installation
```
pip install opencv-python
```

Pytesseract installation for Linux
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
sudo apt-get install libtesseract-dev
```

For windows download file for your achitechture and just click next
